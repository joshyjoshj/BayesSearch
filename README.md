# BayesSearch

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The package gives functions to implement Bayesian Search theory in R
from start to finish. There are helper functions to create valid
probability density functions and 3 different search types as well as a
custom melt function to aid visualization and analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BayesSearch from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joshyjoshj/BayesSearch")
```

## Creating a valid prior

The first step in any Bayesian modelling is thinking about your problem
and setting a prior. In the case of search theory this would be the
likely distribution of the location of the object. Maybe the easiest way
to think about this on a small scale is to think about the values of the
grid squares relative to each other. For example consider a 2 by 2
matrix. Picking row 1 and column 2 (1,2) as an initial grid square we
can assign a value of 1 to it. Now square (2,1) we think is twice as
likely as (1,2) to contain the object as (1,1) hence we assign a value
of 2 to this square. This can be repeated for the other 2 values and
lets say gives the matrix:

$$ \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ 2 & 5 \end{pmatrix} $$

However, this is not a valid distribution as the sum of the entries is
not 1. We can use the `create_prior_grid()` function to solve this:

``` r
#Loading package
library(BayesSearch)

#Creating relative value matrix
mat_rel <- matrix(c(3,2,1,5), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

#Creating prior using create_prior_grid function
prior <- create_prior_grid(mat_rel)
prior
#>           [,1]       [,2]
#> [1,] 0.2727273 0.09090909
#> [2,] 0.1818182 0.45454545
#> attr(,"type")
#> [1] "prior"
```

You donâ€™t need to use this function before using any of the search
functions but if the matrix entered as the prior is not valid you well
get errors.

## Searching a grid sqaure

For the rest of the examples we will use example matrices created by
`generate_sample_matrix()`. This will assing 3 matrices to the global
environment for use in examples

``` r
generate_sample_matrix(5)

In the global environment should be 3 5 by 5 matrices.
