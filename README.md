<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The package gives functions to implement Bayesian Search theory in R
from start to finish. There are helper functions to create valid
probability density functions and 3 different search types as well as a
custom melt function to aid visualization and analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BayesSearch from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joshyjoshj/BayesSearch")
```

## Creating a valid prior

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(BayesSearch)
## basic example code
```

## Searching a grid sqaure

## Searching a sequence of squares

## Optimal search sequence

## Extracting data

## Visualisation
